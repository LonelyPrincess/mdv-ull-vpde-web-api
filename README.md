# Web APIs

## Introduction

This project showcases the usage of a couple of native web APIs that can be relevant for developing games in this platform. The application is a **simple game where the player can make a character jump**, and it's developed by using plain HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript.

[Web storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) is used to preserve the player's score in the current browser' session as well as the accumulated score across all sessions so far.
