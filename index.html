    <h1>Time to jump!</h1>
    <p>In this small game your only goal is to jump as much as you want. You'll see the counters at the top of the game window increase with every jump you do. How far can you get? That's up to you!</p>
    <h2>Game controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Press <em>"Spacebar"</em> to jump.</li>
      <li>Press <em>"Enter"</em> to enter fullscreen mode.</li>
      <li>Press <em>"Escape"</em> to exit fullscreen mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Game notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep in mind you won't be able to jump again until the character has landed on the floor.</li>
      <li>Counter on the left shows the number of times the character has jumped in the current session. This count will restart when you close the browser.</li>
      <li>Counter on the right shows the number of times the character has jumped since you started playing. This count will be preserved even if you close the browser.</li>
    </ul>
